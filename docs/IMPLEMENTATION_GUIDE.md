### Anticipated Questions
**Q: How accurate is the medical information?**
A: We use Google Gemini AI with carefully crafted prompts and always include disclaimers to consult healthcare providers. We're a supportive tool, not a replacement for medical advice.

**Q: What about data privacy?**
A: Currently session-based (no data stored). Future versions will have secure, encrypted storage with full user control.

**Q: Why voice-first?**
A: Pregnant women are often multitasking - commuting, working, preparing. Voice interaction is hands-free and natural.

**Q: How is this different from pregnancy apps?**
A: Most apps focus on one aspect (tracking, education, or community). We're comprehensive AND conversational. You just ask naturally.

**Q: What's next?**
